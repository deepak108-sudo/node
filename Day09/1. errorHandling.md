* If JSON.parse("Hello Guys") Throws error

Diff b/w JSON.parse and express.json()
JSON.parse want to take whole object as a whole but express.json() can parse stream(small chunk of data/part).

We can handle error using try catch.

### Error
It is an object represent failure in your application.

1. Syntax Error
    Mistakes in code structure (caught before execution)
    ```
        if(true {
            console.log("Hello");
        }
    ```

2. Runtime Error 
    Occurs while the program is running
    ```
        console.log(user.name); //user is undefined

        //TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined.
    ```

3. Logical Errors
    Code runs, but result is wrong(hardest to detect)

    ```
        function add(a,b){
            return a-b; //Logic mistake
        }
    ```

4. Operational Errors(Most common in Backend)
    Happen due to external factors.
    Example:
        Database Connection failed.
        Api timeout
        File not found
        Invalid user input.


### Handling Error
    Using try-catch
